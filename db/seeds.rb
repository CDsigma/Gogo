    title: 'Calamus One - Ultrabike',
    project_description: 'Powered by Ultra-drive mid-motors from Bafang, and driven by carbon belts from Gates, these bikes are ultra-responsive. They’re also ultra-efficient. The Calamus One gives you upto 50 Miles/80 km of range on a single charge, has a detachable battery and quick-charge capabilities. With an integrated weather-proof computer and navigation touchscreen, the One is the only e-bike to offer integrated support for android apps, rider profiles, and real-time self-diagnosis.
    
    To make sure riding on the road is safe for the rider, the bike has inbuilt ultrasonic sensors that gauge traffic from behind and inform the rider if he/she is about to take a turn/change the lane by providing haptic feedback using inbuilt vibration motors in the handlebar. The feedback is intuitive and greatly avoids which could be a fatal crash. 
    
    The bike is google map-enabled to easily navigate anywhere around the world using a global network card and a GPS chip that comes inbuilt into the bike.
    
    The bike also has an ultra-fast biometric scanner for locking, unlocking and rider profile recognition. The scanner is a capacitive fingerprint scanner that is located just below the screen on the handlebar.
    
    The GPS and GSM worldwide chip enables worldwide tracking of the bike in case it gets lost or stolen. You can track it very easily using the Find my ride feature on our mobile application. The tracking shows the bike history and informs the user of the location in case a thief is trying to steal the bike.
    
    Component theft is a big problem in all cities around the world. We have come up with patent-pending theft-proof fasteners that can only be opened using a special tool that is provided with the bike. These fasteners look very similar to the conventional fasteners but cannot be accessed with conventional tools.
    
    You parked your bike in the parking lot and someone is trying to steal or mess with your bike. How do you know? The bike has a built-in anti-theft alarm that works in 2 stages when someone is trying to steal or tamper with the bike. First is a warning provided to the thief in case of an attempt where the owner is also informed through the mobile app, if he/she continues tampering then a loud alarm comes on and another warning is sent to the owner via the app.
        
    The bike has a patent-pending smart lock that can be accessed using the mobile app to lock/unlock the bike. The lock is a hidden lock integrated into the frame of the bike which also automatically locks unlock the bike with a simple fingerprint scan or if selected under options you are in the proximity.

    title: 'Ninebot MAX: Ultimate Electric Scooter by Segway',
    project_description: 'Segway-Ninebot, a leader in personal mobility, is proud to add the MAX to its popular Ninebot KickScooter family. The MAX is the perfect combination of the M365 and the ES4. With significant improvements in every aspect, The MAX is more powerful than ever. 

MAX Range: 40.4 miles
MAX Power: 350W-700W propulsion
MAX Speed: 15.5-18.6mph (25-30 km/h)
MAX Comfort: 10-inch pneumatic tires
MAX Payload: 220 lbs (100 kg)
MAX Climb: 20% climbing angle
MAX Portability: built-in charger & one-step folding

The urban mobility revolution is here. Featuring the longest mileage from Segway-Ninebot, robust tires, and a body made for all terrains, yet still offered at the most attractive price, the Ninebot KickScooter MAX is here to spark a change. The MAX is ideal for all kinds of riders, terrains, and journeys.

Most electric scooters face the problem of limited mileage and battery life. The Ninebot KickScooter MAX changes this with a battery capacity of 551Wh that almost triples the mileage on the Ninebot KickScooter ES2. With a MAX range of 40 miles, you can easily ride 162 laps around a standard running track in a single charge, or complete a full marathon PLUS another half marathon. Go green by commuting to work on your MAX and recharge it only once a week.

Riding on rough roads can be challenging for electric scooter users. We understand that and want to make your journey more comfortable. Drawing inspiration from bicycle designs, we developed 10-inch tubeless pneumatic tires with the shock-absorption to make your ride smoother and more stable, even on rough surfaces or speed bumps.

With revolutionary upgrades to the propulsion power, you can now enjoy greater freedom and convenience when you cruise around on your MAX. The high torque motor gives the MAX a top speed of up to 15.5-18.6mph on level ground. The 350W-700W of power provides the MAX with sustainable propulsion on all kinds of road conditions.

Say goodbye to having a spinning wheel when your electric scooter is going up a steep slope, MAX can climb slopes around 20%, allowing it to go uphill easily. Rear-wheel drive offers you a better solution to acceleration, stability, and brake. 

The MAX comes with a one-step folding system that makes it the ultimate electric scooter for people who are always on the go.  The built-in charger lets you recharge it easily when you’re on the go without having to carry along a bulky charging device. You just need to bring along a pocketable cord similar to a phone charging cable. The new charger is more efficient than before. The MAX can be fully charged in 6 hours, two times faster than any previous electric scooters.

Overall, MAX is the perfect choice for mobility, it allows you to move from point A to point B while enjoying the time you spent. You wont be tired even with 10 miles daily commute or a short trip, and no need to worry about the range issue. Ride on and explore your city and countryside in a new way!

    title: 'SuperMini - Credit Card Size Power Bank',
    project_description: 'SuperMini is a credit card size 10,000mAh portable charger, which can be easily put in your pocket and extend your phone usage for 2-3 days. With 18W Power Delivery, it can fast charge your iPhone X up to 50% within 30 mins.
    
    One of the most popular portable charger capacities is 10,000mAh. This will generally give you a few days’ worth of mobile phone recharges. But many people go with a smaller capacity because they feel that a typical 10,000mAh charger takes up too much space. That’s where SuperMini comes in.
    
    SuperMini is 30% smaller than a traditional 10,000mAh external battery, so it fits in virtually any bag or pocket. Here’s how we did it. SuperMini uses a type of battery cell called 21700. Each cell provides 5,000mAh of charge capacity, making them 50% more energy dense than the cells used in a typical chargers. It takes just two of these cells to reach 10,000mAh, while most portable chargers use three cells.
    
    SuperMini also supports up to 18W of fast charging capability through both its USB-C port and USB-A port. With up to 18W of Power Delivery (PD), SuperMini can charge iPhone X up to 50% in 30 mins with a USB-C to Lightning cable.
    
    The USB-C PD port also enables rapid 3- hour recharge performance. A standard external battery may take more than five hours to recharge at 2 amps. Its USB-A port supports ZEN+2.0 with Adaptive Quick Charge, taking advantage of the rapid-charging capabilities of compatible QC 3.0 devices.
    
    A well-designed product is worth showing off. SuperMini is available in Black, Silver, and our stunning new Blue Horizon. SuperMini boldly adopted this distinctive blue ombre color which is usually seen on high-end smartphones, but is very rare in portable chargers. It is not only hard to implement on the finished surface, but could also greatly increases the cost of production. We spent several months and tried dozens of colors before finally choosing Blue Horizon. To achieve the best surface color for SuperMini, our designers and project colleagues spent over 500 hours to optimize and test many different surface treatments. We hope you love the result!
    
    With USB-C PD (Power Delivery) technology and 10,000mAh of charge capacity, SuperMini conveniently maintains 1-2 days of mobile power for flagship phones and tablets, and can nearly double the battery life of smaller laptops. SuperMini’s broad compatibility extends to Apple, Samsung Galaxy, Huawei, OnePlus and Nintendo products, to name a few.
